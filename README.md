# @wpbot for Mastodon

A collection of sources used by [@wpbot@wptoots.social](https://wptoots.social/@wpbot), bringing you the best WordPress content to your Mastodon timeline.

## Contribute a source

To contribute/remove a source, change `/src/assets/sources.json` and create a PR. Please add only one source per PR and explain why the source should be added.

The bot will be syncing the sources file several times per day, so new sources will be fetched quite fast after the PR is merged.
