If you do not stop, you will\n              no longer be welcome on wptoots.social.

Our\n            primary weapon against them is a silent block (our mods are very\n            responsive!) and moving on as if nothing happened. In the event this\n            is not possible, we ask that you host your own infrastructure to\n            forge such a counter maneuver against a group. Keep it off\n            wptoots.social. We will remove any account who gains a reputation\n            for \"stirring the pot\" or \"engaging with conflict\" on our site,\n            despite how virtuous or noble the effort may be. wptoots.social is\n            not the place for this.\n          </p>\n\n          <header>\n            <h3>Moderation</h3>\n          </header>\n          <p>\n            Our moderators are not the fediverse police. Your presence on\n            wptoots.social should not become a burden to our moderators.

As a community member if you get on our moderators radar\n            you are likely doing something very offensive.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We believe in patience and understanding. There is a good chance\n            that expectations have not been set or a policy has not been made\n            clear.
