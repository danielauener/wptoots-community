Chances are, if the entity is\n            seeking profit, we are dealing with a corporate account. <br />\n            In other words if you intend to create an account for a business,\n            you should read this document because this document is exclusively\n            for people like you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The WordPress Community is a diverse community and has always\n            included individuals and corporations of all sizes, both valuably\n            contributing.
